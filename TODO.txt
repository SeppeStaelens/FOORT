TODO and wishlist:
------------------

*** TOP PRIORITY:

--- Equatorial orbits problem?? Also glitches at rings (log r? stepsize?)

--------------------------------

*** PRIORITY:

--- Speed improvements? Caching multiple geodesics per thread (to avoid omp critical statements)

--- ViewScreen procedures understand/better/more general

--------------------------------

*** ALSO TODO:

--- Ring fuzzball metric?

--- better int/size_t types etc

--- Commenting (especially Mesh/View + Integrator + Geodesic + GeodesicOutputHandler)

--- document “add” procedures

--- revisit all variables (bool? long? unsigned? etc)

--- (unit) testing

--------------------------------

*** WISHLIST:

---- Fast "compiled" version?

--- Code own config handler?
