TODO and wishlist:
------------------

*** TOP PRIORITY:

--- better int/size_t types etc -- revisit all variables (bool? long? unsigned? etc)

--- document “add” procedures + document all config options

--- ?? Mesh: more efficient making new subdividing (don't go through every pixel again!?), also neighbors?

--------------------------------

*** PRIORITY:

--- ViewScreen procedures: flat to locally flat; stationary/axisymmetric implementation

--- specific Mesh for rings?
--- Mesh intermediate saving/loading functions?

--------------------------------

*** ALSO TODO:

--- Other metrics?

--- SpherePositionDiagnostic and starry sky picture

--- Commenting (especially Mesh/View + Integrator + Geodesic + GeodesicOutputHandler)

--- document “add” procedures

--- revisit all variables (bool? long? unsigned? etc)

--- (unit) testing

--------------------------------

*** WISHLIST:

--- >4D metric but 4D asymptotics (so still 2D viewscreen) -- like Pierre's solitons!

---- Fast "compiled" version?

--- Code own config handler?
