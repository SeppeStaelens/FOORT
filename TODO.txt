TODO and wishlist:
------------------

*** TOP PRIORITY:

--- RL higher res look ok?
--- push to development
--- Ubuntu test directory creation
--- merge with master
--- RL M1 vs S2?

--- ?? Mesh: more efficient making new subdividing (don't go through every pixel again!?), also neighbors?

--------------------------------

*** PRIORITY:

--- ViewScreen procedures: flat to locally flat; stationary/axisymmetric implementation

--------------------------------

*** ALSO TODO:

--- Other metrics?

--- SpherePositionDiagnostic and starry sky picture

--- other “add” procedures (Mesh, Source)

--- (unit) testing

--------------------------------

*** WISHLIST:

--- specific Mesh for rings?
--- Mesh intermediate saving/loading functions?

--- >4D metric but 4D asymptotics (so still 2D viewscreen) -- like Pierre's solitons!

--- Code own config handler?
