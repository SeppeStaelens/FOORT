TODO and wishlist:
------------------

*** STILL TO INVESTIGATE:
X Pre-allocating output vector slower?? --> benchmark tests with push vs pre-allocate+random access in MULTIPLE threads!
http://igoro.com/archive/gallery-of-processor-cache-effects/


*** TOP PRIORITY:


--- CUDA/GPU:
- Notes:
--- Following https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html
--- Version Windows 10 x86_64 (Cuda 12.0.0)

--------------------------------

*** PRIORITY:

--------------------------------

*** ALSO TODO:

--- Other metrics? (Pierre?)

--- Starry sky picture from GeodesicPositionDiagnostic value/output

--- document other “add” procedures (for Mesh, Source)

--- (unit) testing

--------------------------------

*** ISSUES:

****** Metric.h & Metric.cpp
--- make checks that always returning good numbers (not nan)??

****** Mesh.h & Mesh.cpp
X (SquareSubdivisionMesh is obsolete; Index is const in V2) SquareSubdivisionMesh::PixelInfo::Index is not const but should be. However, if const, then operations between m_CurrentPixelQueue and m_AllPixels need to implement move instead of copy operations! (Unknown if this will introduce more or less overhead?!)

****** ViewScreen.h & ViewScreen.cpp
--- support for other types of geodesics

--------------------------------

*** WISHLIST:

--- Mesh intermediate saving/loading functions?

--- implementing arbitrary precision, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/high_precision/use_multiprecision.html 

--- >4D metric but 4D asymptotics (so still 2D viewscreen) -- like Pierre's solitons!

--- Code own config handler?
