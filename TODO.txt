Theory
"equations"

Code - "basic" features
--- geodesic initialization
--- integration schemes
---> tests: circular orbit, spherical orbits (look at Fabio's paper  2018 n1)
---> performance (scaling with threads)


Code - specific / new features
--- output & analysis, diagnostics, terminations
--- adaptive mesh
--- radiative transfer (disc), equatorial passes (discuss non equatorial metrics) -> visamps


Demonstration / applications
--- fuzzball flex, BHs


documentation not in paper
metrics where?? either appendix or in documentation??




TODO and wishlist:
------------------
*** PRIORITY (before publication):

--- Output/graphing etc. pipelines (python, Mathematica)
--- incl starry sky picture from GeodesicPositionDiagnostic value/output
---> finish Python PhotonRingAnalysis scripts (test on Kerr for visamp?!)
---> finish Python plotting scripts

--- document Python scripts (in output section in FOORT documentation)

--- FOORT Physics documentation (integrations, adaptive mesh, diagnostics (four-color, emission, visamps), metrics)

--- document other “add” procedures (for Mesh, Source)

--- delete mesh v1

--- Other metrics:
---> Pierre topological star (+others?)
---> Schwarzschild "scalarwall" and bubbled resolution?
---> SUSY BH + 2-center FB + ring FB
---> boson star??




------------------------------
*** WISHLIST FUTURE:

--- (ViewScreen) support for other types of geodesics

--- Mesh intermediate saving/loading functions?

--- implementing arbitrary precision, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/high_precision/use_multiprecision.html 

--- >4D metric but 4D asymptotics (so still 2D viewscreen) -- like Pierre's solitons!

--- Code own config handler?

--- "Script" to go from symbolic metric to C++ code

--- (unit) testing

--- CUDA/GPU version:
- Notes:
--- Following https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html
--- Version Windows 10 x86_64 (Cuda 12.0.0)
