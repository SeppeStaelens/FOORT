TODO and wishlist:
------------------

*** TOP PRIORITY:

--- CUDA/GPU:
- Notes:
--- Following https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html
--- Version Windows 10 x86_64 (Cuda 12.0.0)

--------------------------------

*** PRIORITY:

--- ViewScreen procedures: flat to locally flat; stationary/axisymmetric implementation

--- makefile flag -lstdc++fs vs -lstdc++ (always ok to use fs? needed for cluster)

--------------------------------

*** ALSO TODO:

--- Other metrics?

--- SpherePositionDiagnostic and starry sky picture

--- document other “add” procedures (for Mesh, Source)

--- (unit) testing

--------------------------------

*** ISSUES:

****** Metric.h & Metric.cpp
--- make checks that always returning good numbers (not nan)??

****** Diagnostics.h & Diagnostics.cpp
--- GeodesicPositionDiagnostic::FinalDataValDistance() not implemented correctly yet

****** Utilities.h & Utilities.cpp
--- Utilities::GetFirstLineInfoString should also return information about Integrators, possibly also Diagnostics?

****** Mesh.h & Mesh.cpp
--- SquareSubdivisionMesh::PixelInfo::Index is not const but should be. However, if const, then operations between m_CurrentPixelQueue and m_AllPixels need to implement move instead of copy operations! (Unknown if this will introduce more or less overhead?!)

****** ViewScreen.h & ViewScreen.cpp
--- support for other types of geodesics; correct/general initialization

--------------------------------

*** WISHLIST:

--- specific Mesh for rings?
--- Mesh intermediate saving/loading functions?

--- implementing arbitrary precision, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/high_precision/use_multiprecision.html 

--- >4D metric but 4D asymptotics (so still 2D viewscreen) -- like Pierre's solitons!

--- Code own config handler?
